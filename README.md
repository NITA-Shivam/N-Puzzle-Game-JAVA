# N-Puzzle-Game-JAVA
This is a basic game in JAVA. In this game, we have nXn Grid containing numbers from 1 to nX(n-1) numbers placed in a sequential manner. Now we shuffled the numbers by generating the random numbers .finally we have to place all the numbers at its correct position present in the square board by moving only adjacent numbers to empty tile. Here I have used  Oops concept of JAVA and JAVA  Swing API for making  the game more user-friendly.
